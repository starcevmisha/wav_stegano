Hello, How are you?
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory
or directory path. If optional members is given, it must be a subset
of the list returned by getmembers(). Directory information like owner,
 modification time and permissions are set after all members have been
  extracted. This is done to work around two problems: A directory’s
  modification time is reset each time a file is created in it. And,
  if a directory’s permissions do not allow writing, extracting files
  to it will fail.
